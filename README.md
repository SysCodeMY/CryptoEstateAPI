# What Is An API
An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

# CryptoEstate API
CryptoEstate is a blockchain-powered digital asset management platform aims to provide a secure, transparent and verifiable method to digitize real-world assets and manage ‘rights’ of creation, ownership, usage & transfer. Developers can build their own application or program to interact with CryptoEstate platform via API to view data that are allowed by CryptoEstate.
